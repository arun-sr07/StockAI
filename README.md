What the LLM-Based RAG Chatbot does???

An LLM-powered chatbot that uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to analyze stock market data. The chatbot processes **fundamental analysis reports (PDFs)** and **historical stock prices (CSV files)** to provide insights, predict trends, and answer user queries about stock performance.

Motivation for the project:

Stock market analysis requires both **fundamental insights** (company reports, financial statements) and **technical data** (historical prices, trends). Manually analyzing these datasets is complex and time-consuming. This project leverages **LLM and RAG techniques** to build an intelligent chatbot that assists investors by retrieving relevant stock information and generating insightful responses in real-time.
